<h1> Human-made Climate Change discussion on Reddit </h1>

This blog-post investigates the phenomena of Climate Change, more specifically the "man-made or not"-discussion and which factors influence the opinion of Redditors regarding the Climate Change discussion.

The investigations are based on submissions and comments posted on Reddit, in the period of Fall 2014 to Spring 2022 - the period between the release of the 5th and 6th edition of the IPCC assessment report. The data consists of ??? comments and ??? submissions about climate change, from a total of ??? Redditors from a multitude of subreddits. In addition, real world data, in the shape of 1704 natural disasters in that same period, and the severity of these based on the amount of people affected has been downloaded from The international disasters database, EM-DAT. The investigation will take us through the evolution of the opinion of Redditors through time, as well as look at some of the multiple different factors that could affect the opinion of the Redditors - namely the amount of engagement on the relevant parts of the social network, the severity of natural disasters in the real world, as well as whether the opinion of Redditors are affected by what is known as echo-chambers, or specific authorities in the social network.

So let's get started!

Firstly, we'd like to see how our data evolves on a yearly basis. The following plot shows how the size of the network, evolves through time, scattered with regards to the average yearly opinion score.
